## Description

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How does it work?

Calculating the carbon emissions of website is somewhat of a challenge, but we have been working for many years to develop and refine a methodology for this purpose. Our hope is that this will help raise awareness and encourage more eco-friendly approaches to be adopted throughout the web design industry.

### Which pages can be tested?

Any website can be tested but only sites that comply with the following guidelines are included in our ranking tables:

- Can be accessed by the public through a standard web browser
- Do not require login
- Allow search engines
- Contain unique content aimed at human visitors â€“ this excludes holding pages, error pages, server notification pages, demo pages or pages that are generally useless (this is highly subjective)
- Are free from illegal or explicit content

### How was this plugin built?

Carbon Log was built with: [wppb.me](https://wppb.me/) and the [Website Carbon API](https://www.websitecarbon.com/api/).
